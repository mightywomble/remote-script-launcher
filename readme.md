# SSH Web Dashboard & Automation Hub

A powerful, self-hosted web interface for managing SSH hosts, executing commands, and automating tasks. This Flask application provides a centralized dashboard to manually run or schedule scripts across multiple servers, with AI-powered assistance for script generation and output analysis.

## Summary

This tool is designed for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need to manage multiple remote Linux servers efficiently. It replaces the need for manual SSH sessions by providing a clean, web-based UI to run commands, manage a library of saved scripts, and schedule recurring tasks with notifications. The integration with the Gemini API adds a layer of intelligence, helping users generate complex scripts from natural language and understand command outputs without leaving the application.

## Features

-   **Centralized Host Management**:
    
    -   Add, edit, and delete SSH hosts with a friendly name, hostname, and username.
        
    -   Test SSH connectivity to any host with a single click.
        
    -   Visually manage all your servers from a single pane.
        
-   **Advanced Command & Script Execution**:
    
    -   A central editor for writing and running commands.
        
    -   **Run as Sudo**: Execute commands with elevated privileges.
        
    -   Select multiple hosts to run commands or scripts on simultaneously.
        
    -   View real-time results and error outputs from each host in a dedicated pane.
        
-   **AI-Powered Script Suggestion**:
    
    -   Click the "Suggest Script" (<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>) button to open a dialog.
        
    -   Describe a task in natural language (e.g., "find all files larger than 1GB").
        
    -   The AI generates options for a **Bash Command**, **Bash Script**, **Python Script**, and **Ansible Playbook**.
        
    -   Load any suggestion directly into the editor to test, use, or save.
        
-   **AI-Powered Output Analysis**:
    
    -   After running a command, click the "AI Analyze" button.
        
    -   Get a concise summary and troubleshooting tips for the command's output, generated by the Gemini API.
        
-   **Script Library & Management**:
    
    -   Save frequently used commands and scripts for later use.
        
    -   Load, edit, and delete saved scripts from the library.
        
    -   Select and delete multiple scripts in batches.
        
-   **Task Scheduling & Automation**:
    
    -   Schedule any saved script to run on a specific host at a recurring time (daily).
        
    -   View, manage, and delete saved schedules.
        
    -   **Discord Integration**: Automatically sends a report to a configured Discord webhook after a scheduled task runs, including the AI summary and any output/errors.
        
-   **Secure Configuration**:
    
    -   A settings panel to securely store your Gemini API Key and Discord Webhook URL. Keys are stored on the server, not in the browser.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

**Prerequisites**:

-   An Ubuntu/Debian-based system (or similar Linux distribution).
    
-   Python 3.6+
    
-   A configured SSH key pair on the machine running the application. The application uses key-based authentication by default.
    

**Step 1: Install System Dependencies (for Ubuntu/Debian)**

Before setting up the Python environment, ensure you have the necessary system packages installed. `python3-venv` is crucial for creating isolated Python environments.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y

```

**Step 2: Clone the Repository**

```
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

```

**Step 3: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.

```
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

```

_For Windows, the command is `.\venv\Scripts\activate`_

**Step 4: Install Python Packages**

With the virtual environment active, install all the required Python libraries.

```
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Paramiko requests APScheduler

```

## Running the Application

This application requires **two separate processes** to be running in two different terminals for all features to work.

**Terminal 1: Start the Web Server**

This process runs the main Flask application and serves the web interface.

```
python3 app.py

```

The web UI will be accessible at: [**http://127.0.0.1:5012**](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5012 "null")

**Terminal 2: Start the Scheduler**

This process runs in the background to execute your scheduled tasks.

```
python3 scheduler.py

```

_Note: The scheduler must be restarted to activate new or remove deleted schedules._

## How to Use

1.  **Initial Setup**: Open the web interface and click the settings icon (<i class="fas fa-cog"></i>). Enter your **Gemini API Key** and **Discord Webhook URL**.
    
2.  **Add a Host**: Click the `+` icon in the "SSH Hosts" pane to add your first server.
    
3.  **Suggest a Script**: Click the lightbulb icon (<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>), describe a task, and click "Suggest". Load one of the generated scripts.
    
4.  **Run a Command**: Select a host, then click **Run** or **Run as Sudo**.
    
5.  **Analyze Results**: After a command runs, click **AI Analyze** to get a summary.
    
6.  **Schedule a Task**: Save a script, then click the calendar icon (<i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i>) to create a new schedule.
    

## Security Considerations

-   **SSH Authentication**: This application is built with the assumption that you are using **SSH key-based authentication**. The user running the Flask app must have their SSH keys configured to connect to the target hosts without a password.
    
-   **Sudo Privileges**: The "Run as Sudo" feature assumes the connecting user has **passwordless sudo** configured on the target hosts.
    
-   **Network Exposure**: The application runs on `0.0.0.0` by default, meaning it's accessible from your local network. For security, run it behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx) and implement proper authentication and firewall rules if you plan to expose it more widely.
